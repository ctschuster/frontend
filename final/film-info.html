<!-- Final assignment:
For the final project you will create a form, complete with HTML, various form input types, CSS and
JavaScript validation. You are encouraged to use all or most of the techniques we’ve studied in the
course as well as any you’ve developed along the way. You may freely consult both course and Internet
resources for ideas, inspiration and skill refreshers, but all designs, HTML, CSS and JavaScript should
be your own. For detailed instructions, please see the Instructions section below.

Step-By-Step Assignment Instructionsless 
Assignment Topic:

You can create any type of form for any type of purpose you want - a customer service form, a food
order form, product purchase form, survey, contact form, etc.

Guidelines and Instructions:

You must create a form with 7 or more inputs of types you choose. We have studied a variety of input
types, such as text, radio, checkbox, etc. You should decide a purpose for your form and design it to
meet these requirements. The form may have any purpose you like. Examples include customer service
form, food order form, product purchase, survey, contact form, etc.

Your final submission must include the following:

Include a 3-5 sentence description of the form’s purpose. Explain why you chose it and any details you care to mention.
Include working HTML, CSS, at least one image, and JavaScript validation. For the purposes of this assignment, you may 
use either an internal or external stylesheet, even though external is typically preferred. If you use an external 
stylesheet or any other external files, you must upload them all and name in your documentation (see below) all of
the files used to make the project work.
Include any documentation that a reviewer should have in order to understand, test and evaluate the work you have submitted.
Your form should have 7 or more inputs that represent at least 3 of the types we have studied. Do not use the type submit button.
Inputs must have some sort of validation, including at least two JavaScript functions. Validation should occur on events such as onclick or onblur.
A minimum of 3 separate CSS classes or IDs are used in some way.
Use both HTML and JavaScript comments to document your work throughout your submission.
Students may use course sample files for ideas, but do not submit course files as your project.
Review criterialess 
You will be assessed on your ability to meet all of the stated requirements in the instructions section, so pay
attention to the requirements. As long as you are able to meet all of the requirements you will get full points.
If a peer reviewer sees that you haven't met all of the requirements, the rubric is setup to dock points. For
example, one requirement is that your form must have at least 5 inputs (though more is great) of at least
3 different types. If your form doesn't have a minimum of 5 inputs, or these don't fall into at least 3 different
types, then you will be docked a few points accordingly. For credit, you also must evaluate at least two of your peers.
